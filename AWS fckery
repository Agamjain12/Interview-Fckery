virtual private cloud in public cloud 
cloud repatriation: process of moving data, applications, and services from a public cloud to a private cloud or on-premises data center.

IAM -> (users, policies, groups), roles

EC2(Elastic cloud compute)

why the prefix Elastic
it is provided to the services which can be scaled up and down 

types of EC2 instances: 
general purpos 
compute optimized 
memory optimized 
storage optimized 
accelarate optimized 

choice of region: low letancy

Accessing ec2 instance from terminal: ssh -i pem_file.pem ubuntu@publick_ip (considerin you're using linux as os in the instance, ubuntu will be the default user)

you'll stumble upon an error saying pem_file.pem is too open. to fix this: chmod 600 pem_file.pem 

installing jenkins in ubuntu:
i. we'll be needing java installed on the system, run: sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk 

check status of jenkins: systemctl jenkins status

jenkins runs on 8080,to check: go to your browser and type: http://public_ec2_instance_password:8080, it'll be running but won't be accessible. 

To make it accessible: go to security region of the instance and click on security groups, in enbound traffic rule, click on the edit button, add a new rule:
add type as custom TCP, add port as 8080 and in source add Anywhere IPv4 


VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD

how to define size of VCP: define ip address ranges, now splitting the ip range and assigning them into sub projects is called subnets.
