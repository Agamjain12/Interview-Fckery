How do you ensure high availability in your backend system?
Answer:
Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
Deploy the application across multiple availability zones or regions in cloud platforms.
Implement database replication with failover support (e.g., PostgreSQL replication).
Use circuit breakers and retries to handle service failures gracefully.
Add health checks and rolling updates during deployments.


How would you debug a slow API endpoint?
Answer:
Profile the API using tools like New Relic, Postman, or Datadog to measure response times.
Check Database Queries:
Use EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify slow SQL queries.
Add indexes or optimize queries.
Inspect Logs for errors or bottlenecks.
Load Test using tools like JMeter or k6 to simulate traffic.
Optimize code, add caching (e.g., Redis), or enable compression (e.g., gzip).


What is a trigger in SQL?
Answer:
Trigger: A database object that automatically executes or fires when certain events occur in a table or view (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Use Case: For example, updating a log table every time a record is updated in a user table.
